Structural programming organizes code into reusable blocks using sequences, loops, and conditionals. It improves readability and maintainability by avoiding unstructured jumps. Examples include C, Pascal, and Fortran.
**Structured Programming Language (SPL)** is a programming paradigm that promotes writing clear, well-organized code using control structures like loops, conditionals, and sequences. It avoids unstructured programming practices, such as the use of "goto" statements, which can make code difficult to follow and maintain.

### Key Characteristics of SPL:
1. **Modularity**: Programs are divided into smaller, manageable functions or modules, enhancing reusability and readability.
2. **Control Structures**: Uses constructs like `if-else`, `for`, `while`, and `switch` for decision-making and iteration, providing a clear flow of execution.
3. **Top-Down Approach**: Programs are designed from a high-level overview, breaking down into specific details and tasks, making development systematic and organized.
4. **Readability & Maintainability**: Structured code is easier to read, understand, debug, and maintain, reducing complexity in large projects.

Examples of structured programming languages include **C**, **Pascal**, and **Ada**.
